  "body": "# OHeroV2\r\nVersion 2. Quintus Engine!\r\n\r\nContinuing the OHero project. Attempting to set up the user-facing gameplay using Quintus.\r\n\r\nTODO: Figure out how to user Spring server for middleware.\r\n\r\nTODO: Figure out what database to use. SQL...something.\r\n\r\nTODO: Build into Ionic App? Conflicts with Angular.js?\r\n\r\nThe overall goal is to have a mobile/desktop app wherein the user can build their 'hero' and have the character grow in power and capabilities for mundane events attached to their account --- such as returning to a specific location, travel distance, and perhaps eventually purchases or health monitoring.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay aspect is expressed in the 'event' feature. The player will be able to take their hero into sidescrolling levels, with enemies to defeat and items to collect to further increase their hero's abilities. Like daydreaming during a busy day, the user can take a break to go be a 'hero' at any point, with levels altering based on geolocation data (indoors, outdoors, urban, rural, weather etc).\r\n\r\nMoonshot idea is to be able to create teams or guilds to join, so that progress is shared with friends and (as suggested by Tariq Hook) support asynchronous completion of tasks while rewarding all associated members.\r\n\r\nPvP support is HIGHLY unlikely. This is meant to be a cooperative ongoing experience. User + Friends vs World.\r\n",
